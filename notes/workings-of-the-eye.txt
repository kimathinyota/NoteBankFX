In old age, it is these muscles which
become slack and the eye loses its ability to focus at short distance. Iris (pupil): an aperture tht controls the amount of light entering the eye.&nbsp;</span></li><li><font face="Arial"><b>Cornea&nbsp;</b></font><span style="font-family: Arial;">(sclera)</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">: provides protection to the delicate iris.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Choroid</b>
has blood vessels that supply nutrition and is opaque to cut down the amount of light. Retina: &nbsp;is on the inside of the eye, which is where light falls to form an image.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Fovea</b>: By this
system, muscles rotate the eye, and shape the lens, to form an image on the fovea (focal
point) where the majority of sensors are situated.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Blind spot</b> is where the optic nerve
starts; there are no sensors there.&nbsp;</span></li></ul></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>Focusing:</b> &nbsp;involves shaping the lens, rather than positioning it as in a camera. The lens
is shaped to refract close images greatly, and distant objects little, essentially by ‘stretching’
it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b>High acuity</b>:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Good vision has high acuity (sharpness), which implies that there
must be very many sensors in the area where the image is formed.</span></p></body></html>
